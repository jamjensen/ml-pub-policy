last posting date ends with the last outcome date
importance of gap: 
* what do you do today... if you're predicting 60 days from today, need last posting date to be 60 days prior

metrics should be calculated on % of population and not on score thresholds
* scores are not comparable 
* want to calculate on percentage of people 


Model that has higher precision, will also have higher recall. 

You don't have to discretize by default. 




1. Better way than hand picking categorical variables (lines 7-12 in pipeline) when creating dummy variables. 
	1. In `get_train_splits` I discretize and make dummies out of every column? Is this the right way to go about it? Is there are better way? Do I have to make dummies out of everything, or should I leave as continuous instead of discretizing? 

2. Print AUC-ROC curve for every model, or just the top model? 
And if you double the resources, you can increase the lift. 

3. Is there a better way to initialize the data frame ? 

If you build a model on six months and test every day —> 
	* would inform us of how does model perform as it gets old 

Top Models: DT, LR, RF,

Keep as continuous to start bc discretize throws  away information
	* RG: “keep age as continuous, then notices issue with 12-18, makes discretized variable <12, 12-18, >18
	* what is the information you lose through discretization?
